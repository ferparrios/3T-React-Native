# 3IT React Native Challenge !

Start downloading the repo from here and then use **yarn** for install the dependencies

# Files

The assets and icons are from Material using **react-native-vector-icons!**

## Create files and folders

Every File or Component has a **.tsx** file and a **.presets.ts**, in the first one I use the render and the logic for the app, and in the second one I put all the styles.

## Starting the Project

For run the project you need to use **npx react-native run-ios** or **npx react-native run-android** for runing in your device of preference.

## Observations

The icons work good, but in iPhone maybe you cannot see the icons, this is why my Xcode was updating and don't let me add the Fonts folder in the XCode project, I can correct this when I can solve the issue.

Maybe you can find an error on the api call, that happens because the API CMF Bancos it's updating, when the update is finished you can access to the data.
